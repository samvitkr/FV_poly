    % treatment of the wall-parallel mean (i = j = 1, or, equivalently, kx = kz = 0), which was omitted above:
    % - x and z component: the mean x and z component of the irrotational part is zero by definition, so that the mean
    %                      of the solenoidal part coincides with the mean of the original data. This is correctly
    %                      enforced above, since scalarPotential(1, 1, :) == 0.
    % - y component: functional orthogonality (which ensures existence and uniqueness) requires that the y-component
    %                of the irroational part coincides with the y-component of the original data on the wall. The
    %                solenoidal part is therefore zero on the wall, which implies that its mean is zero on the wall also.
    %                The solenoidal constraint and periodic boundary conditions require that the mean of the solenoidal
    %                part is constant throughout the domain and coincides with the value at the wall, which is zero.
    %                We therefore set the y-component of the kx = kz = 0 mode explicity to zero below.
